Explains the data and processing used to create the tidy dataset

## Data Source

The data comes from the [UCI HAR Dataset], which includes sensor data from smartphones worn by 30 people doing different activities; walking, sitting, and laying down.

## What the Script Does

`run_analysis.R`:
1. Merges the training and test sets.
2. Keeps only mean and standard deviation measurements.
3. Replaces activity codes with names (like "WALKING").
4. Cleans up variable names to be more readable.
5. Creates a tidy dataset with the **average of each variable for each activity and each subject**.

## What’s in `tidy_dataset.txt`

Each row = one person doing one activity  
Each column = the average of a specific sensor measurement (like accelerometer or gyroscope)

## Naming

Some quick examples:
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanX` = average of body acceleration in the X direction (time domain)
- `FrequencyBodyGyroscopeSTDZ` = standard deviation of body gyroscope data on Z axis (frequency domain)

## Units

The measurements are in normalized units — no specific scale, since they come from smartphone sensors.
